Hi, I'm Silke 👋

I'm a full-stack software engineer specializing in TypeScript, currently building asset tokenization platforms for financial institutions at [SettleMint](https://github.com/settlemint).

With 10+ years in JavaScript/TypeScript ecosystems, I focus on creating calm, stable systems that don't generate emergencies or single points of failure. I measure success in trust, ease, and autonomy.

Most of my work lives in private repositories, but I'm always open to interesting conversations about distributed systems, blockchain infrastructure, or building developer tools that don't make people's lives harder.
