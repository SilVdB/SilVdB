Hi, I'm Silke 👋

I'm a full-stack engineer specializing in TypeScript with 10+ years experience, currently building Digital Asset Lifecycle Platforms for financial institutions at [SettleMint](https://settlemint.com).

I'm a fast learner, comfortable filling gaps across the stack: smart contracts, backend, frontend, UX - wherever the team needs me most. I take pride in building calm, stable systems that don't require constant firefighting.

**Core technologies**: TypeScript, Node.js, Solidity, Kubernetes, React  
**Certified**: CKAD

Most work is in private repos, but always open to connecting with great engineers and interesting challenges.
